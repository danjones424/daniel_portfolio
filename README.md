Welcome to the repo for my personal website! This will be my first time trying to really put together a well made personal site that brings together all the things I am capable of.

My initial goals are to have a site that is responsive, fast and ready to be deployed (using heroku).

As I move along with the project, I will update this READEME file.

Happy Coding!
